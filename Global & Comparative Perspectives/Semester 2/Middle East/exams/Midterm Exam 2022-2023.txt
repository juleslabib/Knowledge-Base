Dear all, 

I have uploaded a PP and audio for the midterm exam and the weekly essays. Please remember that you are not permitted to share the audio file with anyone else. I kindly ask you keep the audio to yourself. 

As for the exam itself, it will consist of one question only. You will be invited to bring two Muslim philosophers into conversation with a representative of a contemporary issue and have them debate it in public with you as a moderator. So, for example, what would Avicenna say if he were to meet Richard Dawkins? You need to show knowledge of the topics we covered so far, ability to think about the various meanings of philosophy in medieval Islam, and to show creativity in how you structure the conversation. 

You can pick any issue you like. For example, what would the kalam scholars say to a proponent of veganism if they met. What issues will they discuss? How will they try to convince each other, etc. Any issue is fine. 

Good luck.

Some responses to questions I received:
1. Pick two philosophers we covered in class.
2. Their views have to be reflected accurately. You cannot ascribe false ideas to them.
3. You can structure the exam response however you want. There is no strict demand here.
