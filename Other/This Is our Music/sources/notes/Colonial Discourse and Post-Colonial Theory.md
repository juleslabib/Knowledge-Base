## Imperialism and Colonialism

> All attempts to divorce the explanation of imperialism from the specific developments of capitalism in the late nineteenth century must be regarded as ideological exercises, though often learned and sometimes acute

Hobsbawm, E.J. *the age of imperialism*, Weidenfeld and Nicolson: London, 1987, p.73

> colonialism, the conquest and direct control of other people's land, is a particular phase in the history of imperialism, \[...] the globalisation fo the capitalist mode of production, its penetration of the previous non-capitalist regions of the world and destruction of pre- or noncapitalist forms of social organisation.

#todo explore relationships between negritude and American pan-Africanism

In Fanon:
> attack on negritude as a concept which mirrors the racialisation and continental dynamics of colonialism itself, and constitues a metaphysical rather than a materlialist politics. Fanon's own materialism, however, could be said to abandon him when it comes to the category of 'the nation', which serves as an unproblematic given and a trascendent value, much as 'Africa serves' Seghorn

> Whereas Fanon argues that it is 'the people', Cabral argues that it is 'popular culture' which forms the basis of the anticolonial political struggle While for FGanon national culture cannot exist within the history and domination of colonialism, for Cabral the operations of national culture are in a dialectical relationship with history.

## Negritude

>It \[negritude, N.d.r.] is rooting oneself in oneself, and self-confirmation. \[...] The African personality.
-Senghor, L.S. 

> The drums weep and the drums laugh
-Langston Hughes

> The sum of the cultural values of the black world. \[...] Negritude is necessary in the world today: it is a humanism of the twentieth century

> Each of the great nations that considers itself personally responsible for the "destiny of the world" believes it possesses the key to the understanding of the whole and the other nations. It is an attitude raised from the past.
> -Frobenius, L., The Dstiny of Civilisations

African ontology, diametrically opposed to White European, views the world as "*beyond the diversity of its forms as a fundamentally mobile, yet unique, reality that seeks synthesis*". Where as the tradition of European philosophy has always been one interested in division, in the stark demarcation of the fine line between matter and spirit, substance and essence.
