## Introduction
> Second, the editors have defined the varieties of black nationalism which range, as they see it, from racial solidarity, cultural nationalism and religious nationalism, through economic nationalism (bourgeois and socialist) and political nationalism (both reform and revolutionary), to territorial separatism and Pan-Africanism . By illustrating each type of nationalism in successive phases called "Origins," "Maturation", "Flowering," and "Eclipse," they lay a basis for seeing both the parallels and unique features of the current "Revival ."

The identification of these five phases reflects in an accurate manner the tripartition of colonial artistic production, as it describes and analyses the socio-cultural hummus from which artistic production itself arises. The presence of the last two phases is _possibly_ reflected in artistic production, as after the "flowering" of original Black production, the necessity of posing Black art in relationship to White models slowly dwindles out. The "current revival" that is here mentioned is somewhat also reflected in current music production, as the conscience of the relationship between the Black community and its music is today once again becoming more starkly marked. 


>During four periods, nationalist sentiment in various forms has been prominent in Negro thought: the turn of the eighteenth century, roughly of the Negro People," from 1790 to 1820; the late 1840s and especially the 1850s; the nearly half-century stretching approximately from the 1880s into the 1920s; and since the middle 1960s


### Definitions

>The term "black nationalism" has been used in American history to describe a body of social thought, attitudes, and actions ranging from the simplest expressions of ethnocentrism and racial solidarity to the comprehensive and sophisticated ideologies of Pan-Negroism or Pan-Africanism . Between these extremes lie many varieties of black nationalism, of varying degrees of intensity.

racial solidarity: 
> black people organize themselves on the basis of their common color and oppressed condition

cultural nationalism:
 > contends that black people- in the United States or throughout the world-have a culture, style of life, cosmology, approach to the problems of existence, and aesthetic values distinct from that of white Americans in particular and white Europeans or Westerners in general.
 
 Important distinction to be made: in the first case, Black nationalism can be seen simply as a union of the oppressed under the flag marked with an oppression category, whereas in the second case, the first statement is vastly layered with statements over the cultural and philosophical tradition of the oppressed, charging a fundamentally classist sentiment with much concepts of a higher nature, so that the intersection between the concepts of classist oppression and Black philosophical tradition is almost total, and the two concepts become essentially codependent. 

> Programmatic or institutional manifestations of cultural nationalism include the development of a body of social-science literature-history, philosophy, political science, and the like- written from the Afro-American point of view; the unearthing and publicizing of all the past glories of the race \[_sic_\]; the development of a distinct Afro-American literature, art, and music; the formation of appropriate vehicles for the transmission of Afro- American culture-newspapers, journals, theaters, artistic workshops, musical groups ; the assertion of a distinct life- style and world view in such ways as assuming African or Arabic names, wearing African clothes, and speaking African languages. 

Particularly significant in relationship to Black music - the sudden African awakening, the many jazz musicians who travelled to Africa in search of "Black Roots", the invention of the African Aesthetic in soul jazz, as well as the conversion to Islam and the changing of names of many of the Great jazz musicians.

## Religious nationalism
Religious nationalism is manifested in many different forms, in all religious communities - despite the prevalence of Christian and Islamic experiences. Christianity becomes a vehicle for nationalist sentiment, and so does Islamism - as attested by the foundation of the Nation of Islam and the subsequent birth of the [[Afro-Futurism|Afro-Futurist]] aestehtic. 

## Economic nationalism
Economic nationalism presents itself both in capitalist and socialist guises - in the first case the aim is that of the creation of a Black free market, parallel to the White one, and in the second case, nationalists insist that the abolition of private property is the only means to reach Black financial liberation -

#todo why?
> \[Although\] such socialists should be distinguished from black integrationist socialists like A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin 

> At the opposite extreme are those who call for the reinstatement of preindustrial communalism. Black nation- alist socialists tend to coincide with revolutionary nationalists who apply Marxian theory to the experience of Afro-Ameri- cans, whereas those who favor preindustrial African economic forms tend also to be militant cultural nationalists . Negro capitalists tend to be bourgeois in their political and cultural outlooks as well .

## Political nationalism 
At its core, political nationalism identifies the need for the cease and desist of the present political and social organisation (particularly in respect to the exercise of White power that White politics mediated). In its mildest forms it envisions the election of Black politicians in areas with a high Black population density, whereas at its most extreme it longs for the overthrowing of the present administrative system and the status quo it represents. This second outlook, in particular, relates strongly to the Marxist reading of racial oppression. There is also an interesting interaction between the Marxist reading of reality and extreme cultural nationalism, which creates the ideal of the return to pre-industrial economics and society.

## Emigrationism and territorial separatism

> From the earliest attempts of slaves to capture the ships bearing them to the New World in order to steer them back to Africa, a substantial number of black people have wanted to return to the ancestral homeland . However, to emigrationists for whom Africa was too far away in time and space, or unacceptable for other reasons, the West Indies, South America, Mexico, Canada, and even the island of Cyprus have been touted as potential homelands. 
> Related to emigration is what we may call territorial separatism, a term best applied to the view of those blacks who wanted a share of the country that their labor had made so prosperous but who had no illusions about living in peace and equality with white Americans . 

> Recent and milder forms of territorial separatism are often linked to the concept of political pluralism and advocacy of "black control of the black community."

Both of these ideas have strong roots in the idea of Pan-Africanism, or the idea that people of African descent substantially share similar characteristics, as well as a story of oppression under the White racial frame - in other words, the contact with the West created the sentiment of nationality and shared cultural as well as geographical origins, and the persistent hatred to which Black individuals have been subjected gave birth to, or at least played a definitive role in, the creation of sentiments of national unity within a vast and diverse group of individuals and traditions. 

> Black nationalism and racial integration as ideologies or as programs have often coexisted in organizations, in theories, and in the minds of individual Negro Americans.

> In 1789 the Free African Society of Newport sent a proposal to the Free African Society of Phila- delphia, making a plea for return to Africa as a means for Negroes to escape from conditions in the United States 

## Elijah Muhammad 

During his period as guide of the Nation of Islam (from 1933 onwards), Elijah Muhammad actuated numerous policies aimed at bringing his nationalist separatist views closer to reality. The strong advocacy for the creation of a "complete separation in a state or territory of our own", mixed with his adversity towards "intermarriage or race mixing", together with the incentives towards Black owned businesses in Black communities, paints the picture of  someone with profound cultural roots as well as a revolutionary spirit.
