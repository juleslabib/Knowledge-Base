> Most research in music perception and cognition has focused on a very narrow band of human musical phenomena, namely the tonal concert music of pre-20th-century Western Europe, as filtered through contemporary Europeanderived performance practices

> Even in the work of Lakoff (1987, discussed in the following chapter), which purports to frame linguistic understanding and meaning in terms of the human body and its environment, the theory centers around language. Such work would have it that no non-linguistic modes of discourse exist, and that all meaning is attached to language.

> the emergent, reinforced neural connections between the senses and the motor system form the basis for cognition.

> If we grant that cognition is structured at least to some degree by bodily experience, then we must understand the body to be immersed in an environment that shapes its experience. Hence the philosophy of embodiment also stresses temporal, physical, and sociocultural situatedness.

> A variety of simple truisms support this view. For example, most wind-instrument phrase lengths are naturally constrained by lung capacity. Tactus-heavy urban dance music often makes sonic references to foot-stomping and to sexually suggestive slapping of skin. Blues guitarists, jazz pianists, and *quinto* players in Afro-Cuban rumba are said to "speak" with their hands and fingers. All such instances involve the embodiment of the musical performer and the listening audience.

Microscopic time scale of timing - "microstructure of feel", the physical act of making music as a primary element in creative endeavours. "Ecological level" of music production (Gibbs), Grain of the voice (Barthes). 

Baily and Baily & Driver on the legitimate mode of spatial and kinesthetic modes of cognition when producing music. 

> From my experience with jazz improvisation on the piano, I have found that the kinesthetic/spatiomotor approach and the melodic approach form dual extremes of a continuum

> I can hear with certainty – the certainty of the body, of thrill – that the harpsichord playing of Wanda Landowska comes from her inner body and not from the petty digital scramble of so many harpsichordists (so much so that it is a different instrument). As for piano music, I know at once which part of the body is playing – if it is the arm, too often, alas, muscled like a dancer's calves, the clutch of the finger tips (despite the sweeping flourishes of the wrists), or if on the contrary it is the only erotic part of a pianist's body, the pad of the fingers whose 'grain' is so rarely heard... (Barthes 1977: 189)

> In many cultures, music and movement are inseparable activities, and the physical engagement of the musician in performance is desired and expected. By contrast, Western culture – with its puritanical, idealist suspicion of the body – has tried throughout much of its history to mask the fact that actual people usually produce the sounds that constitute music. As far back as Plato, music's mysterious ability to inspire bodily motion has aroused consternation, and a very strong tradition of Western musical thought has been devoted to defining music as the sound itself, to erasing the physicality involved in both the making and the reception of music (McClary 1991: 136)

> We can cast a similar glance at the "metaphors we play by" – the language and schemas we use to conceptualize and talk about music.

Spacial models for understanding time in musical compositions (Griffiths History of Music)

> "Sound", sensibility, personality and intelligence cannot be separated from an improviser’s phenomenal (as distinct from formal) definition of music. Notions of personhood as transmitted via sounds, and sounds become signs for deeper levels of meaning beyond pitches and intervals. (Lewis 1996: 117)

The present interaction between our perception of music (or, also, of [[Timbre]]) and the personality and psychic state of the performer

> it should be pointed out that the claims of embodied and situated cognition operate alongside the symbolic cognitive methods that traditional knowledge-based systems might exploit.
