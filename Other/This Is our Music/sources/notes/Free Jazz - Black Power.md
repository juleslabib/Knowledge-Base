>  Formally turning away from the danceable, entertainment format of swing, bebop gave jazz at large an in- creased level of respectability, brought it a step closer to Western criteria for art.

>The new music was not only produced and played according to aesthetic norms and cultural codes different from ours; it did not only transgress most of the rules then held to be specific to jazz—it also purported to testify to the oppression of black Americans, to express their revolt, and even to play a role in their revolutionary struggle. In short, it was mixing the unmixable: music and politics. This, indeed, was intolerable for jazz critics, they who had toiled to raise jazz to the level of art, but had done nothing to think about art in terms other than those used by bourgeois aesthetics and consumed by West- ern culture

> 11 1. Jazz Today We see jazz as one of the most meaningful social, aesthetic contributions to America. It is that certain people accept it for what it is, that it is a meaning- ful, profound contribution to America—it is anti-war, it is opposed to the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, it is for Cuba; it is for the liberation of all people. That is the nature of jazz. That’s not far-fetched. Why is that so? Because jazz is a music itself born out of oppression, born out of the enslavement of my people. —Archie Shepp, “Point of Contact: Discussion,” Downbeat Music ’66: The 11th Yearbook (1966), 20.

> Yet immediately, and for over half a century, under pres- sure from commercial, social, racial, cultural factors, this music was leeched and exploited precisely by that which had enslaved Africans, had given birth to racist ideology and used it against them, and which continues to exploit and oppress them today:

> Not only did American society economically and culturally profit from jazz, but in exploiting it for profit, has incessantly controlled and influenced its stylistic development

>  It has imposed its aesthetic and commercial norms, forms, and a finality that were not only not those of the original black music, but, moreover could not, and would not, provide to black Americans what they were seeking in their music

> “New jazz is old jazz. Nothing really new here, ex- cept a message that could never be expressed until now. . . . For a long time a point of view that was not theirs was imposed on black Americans.”2 What purely musical innovations happen in free jazz are first and foremost effects and symptoms of a more general change in the relation of black Americans to their culture and in the role culture plays in their political struggles.

## Malcom X:

>You know why they always say Negroes are lazy? Because they want Negroes to be lazy. They always say Negroes can’t unite, because they don’t want Ne- groes to unite. And once they put this thing in the Negro’s mind, they feel that he tries to fulfill their image. If they say you can’t unite black people, and then you come to them to unite them, they won’t unite, because it’s been said that they’re not supposed to unite. It’s a psycho that they work, and it’s the same way with these statistics.

> One of the things that made the Black Muslim movement grow was its emphasis upon things African. This was the secret to the growth of the Black Muslim movement. African blood, African origin, African culture, African ties. And you’d be surprised, we discovered that deep within the subconscious of the Black man in this country, he’s still more African than he is American. He thinks that he’s more American than African, because the man4 is jiving him, the man is brainwashing him every day.

> Overall, through him the black struggle took an important political step (join- ing W. E. B. Du Bois’s Marxist conclusions) by subordinating the entirety of racial, legal, social, and cultural demands to a more directly political demand: the struggle against American capitalism, which became the main enemy.

> And further: “Because most of the laws in this country are built on attitudes, not justice, not equality, revolution is necessary. Racism, capitalism, colonial- ism and imperialism dominate the lives of people of color around the world— the people of Africa, Asia, Latin America, the colonized minorities who live inside the united states.”11 Malcolm X had already emphasized the deep con- nection between the liberation of American Negroes and that of the people exploited by American imperialism, in order to avoid putting Negroes alone on the “American stage.”

> Our education and culture is the culture of the gun and the culture of resistance to racism and imperialism. 

## Black Beauty
> Under the pressure of these converging forces, the political maturation of black militants and black masses was accompanied by important changes at the ideological level and in the cultural field: the ideological hierarchy was up- ended; the black man and Africa were valorized against the white man and the West, against the “Tom” who imitates them. The Black Muslims adopted Is- lam and renounced their “slave names,” replacing them with an emblematic X. After Islam, African religions and civilizations were called upon; many musi- cians took on Arabic or African names.

> To manifest “black beauty” is not simply to value one’s race and culture; it is also to forcibly extricate oneself from a mode of thinking and a scale of values that systematically devalue all that is black

## Black Nationalism
> Black nationalism therefore appears as a necessary stage in the development of the black struggle in America, the moment of battle on the ideological field, against all the white myths that befuddle the consciousness of the black mass- es, from those directly linked to capitalism (“make a fortune,” “work in order to be integrated”) to those that indirectly support and justify it: “American de- mocracy,” “equality,” “freedom,” etc.

> “Essentially there is no difference, as long as you’re black, where you come from,” notes Cecil Taylor. “The thing that unites us is the sameness in the oppression that we have undergone at the hand of the white man.”13

## Cultural Implications of Jazz
> To the extent that political activists were invoking it, jazz could not remain outside of black movements and struggle. It became a field for ideological conflict between two conceptions of jazz (westernized and Africanized); two conceptions of music (entertaining or functional); a conflict between what pertains to commodity and art and what pretends to activism 

> The black musician is a reflection of the black people, as a cultural and social phenomenon. His goal must be to free America of its inhumanity, on the aesthetic and social levels. The inhumanity of the white American towards the black American, or the inhumanity of the white American towards the white American, are not fundamental in America: they can be exorcised. I think that blacks, through the violence of their struggle, are America’s only hope of salvation. (Archie Shepp)

> And in that atmosphere, brothers and sisters, you’d be surprised what will come out of the bosom of this black man. I’ve seen it happen. I’ve seen black musicians when they’d be jamming at a jam session with white musicians—a whole lot of difference. The white musician can jam if he’s got some sheet mu- sic in front of him. He can jam on something that he’s heard jammed before. If he’s heard it, then he can duplicate it or he can imitate it or he can read it. But that black musician, he picks up his horn and starts blowing some sounds that he never thought of before. He improvises, he creates, it comes from within. It’s his soul, it’s that soul music. It’s the only area on the American scene where the black man has been free to create. And he has mastered it. He has shown that he can come up with something that nobody ever thought of on his horn. (Malcom X)

on the adoption of jazz as a propaganda to further drive in racial division and reclaiming attributes of the Black class

> Free jazz appeared at first to be a purely musical phenomenon, which is to say its determination by politics remained invisible. But under the pressure of political forces around and within it, free jazz was soon conceived by those who made it and those who listened to it as not only having a social function— which old jazz also had in its own way—but also a political status and function in the cultural realm.

> This shows the distance gradually taken by jazz itself and jazz musicians from what has long passed—and still does pass—for “jazz” to the white public,

## Cultural Colonisation
> Musical and aesthetic cri- teria whose origin, moment, and location of emission had not been questioned took hold of jazz, molded it, and fixated it in a series of exact copies, differen- tiated only by variations in details and accessories. What was made took on force of law, and since all that was made was what commerce and ideology de- manded, the criteria of “good” and “true” jazz were white.

> You see, we need music. We’ve always needed a music—our own. We have nothing else. Our writers write like the whites, our painters paint like them. Only our musicians don’t play like the whites. So we created a music for our- selves. When we had it—the old type of jazz—the whites came, and they liked it and imitated it. Pretty soon it was no longer our music (Eric Hobsbawn)

> whites had to start playing jazz for other whites to feel allowed to listen to it and to justify their interest by calling it art. In order to be ac- cepted, what had initially been the music of black Americans could no longer belong to them exclusively.

## Criticism

> Jazz was first “universally” defined as enter- tainment music (by opposition to “serious” classical music), because the label was popular and did not emphasize color. When discussing jazz as art finally became acceptable, it did not change a thing: color was not to be emphasized.

> Even more influential is the prejudice of the black middle class against ev- erything that distinguishes it from the white bourgeois it tries to emulate, es- pecially in rejecting all cultural connections with working class blacks, whom they despise as much as the whites despise them.

> all critics, emphasizing more or less the importance of black musicians—and more and more so as the political role of blacks increased—reached the conclusion that a certain musical equality existed between whites and blacks. This amounted to not taking into account social inequalities or differences in historical, economic, and cultural deter- mination and their respective political spectrums, in the name of humanistic egalitarianism and for fear of being called a reverse racist.

## Che Razza di Musica
> In fact, it seems that jazz criticism still confuses the direct participation of white musicians in a black music—which is on the level of more or less decent imitation, borrowing, or influence of black on white—with the game of influences of white on black, the Western influences on jazz. The fact that jazz was musically born of the assimilation and reinterpretation of a great number of Western musical elements (marching bands, dances, church music, 42 Not a Black Problem, But a White Problem borrowings from classical and contemporary music) does not make it ipso facto assimilable by Western musicians.

> The black’s double extraction, African and American, determines all of his productions in many and complex ways; but this multi-determination is itself the privilege of African Americans. A black musician uses the multiple West- ern traces present in jazz to work on the specific and original character of this multiplicity, this diversity that constitutes jazz as music.

> By mechanically opposing white with black jazzmen, only to resolve this opposition in terms of an equivalence of principle, Western criticism has pre- vented itself once more from thinking of differences as productive and specific to jazz. To define jazz as “syncretic music,” as “a synthesis of Western and Af- rican influences,” might seem to constitute a recognition of those differences. But, in fact, it shows how little they are known, in that they are summoned but once in mythical accounts of the birth of jazz, and understood as having since been resolved, or more precisely, synthesized.

## A Black History of Jazz
> Not by chance are the oldest songs kept by oral tradition work songs. These melodically and rythmically simple (functional) songs are the di- rect product of a system of economical and social exploitation: slavery

> Marxist economists and sociologists have shown that slavery was the result neither of the “inferiority” of blacks, nor of the “perversity” of whites: it was simply a very profitable affair for slave traders, sellers, and breeders, and un- evenly profitable for American planters. Racist arguments were produced after the fact to justify the law of profit, and spread in order to perpetuate it.

> The music of the first generations of slaves (those born in Africa) could only be a reconstitution of African music. Prisoners in a foreign land whose lan- guage they could not yet speak, forced into a kind of labor and a pace they were not used to, they tried for a time—it seems—to adapt to the monotony of agricultural work in American colonies the songs and chants that tradi- tionally accompanied both profane and sacred activities in Africa.

> At the beginning of the slave period, Africans tried to perpetuate their musical traditions. For a time colonizers did not think to oppose it—as long as it did not hamper productivity. But, little by little, obstacles were raised that made the preservation of African cultures impossible. This progressive “disafrican- ization” saw elements of the culture disappear, African elements banned or replaced by new (colonial or Western) elements.

Whole chapter on Black African Music before Jazz

> Deprived of their essential sources of inspiration (fishing, gathering, hunting, war, celebrations, religious ceremonies, etc.) and forced to dedicate all their energy to new and monotonous work (and the automatism dictated by monoculture), plantation slaves adapted their songs to the colonial system of reference that brutally replaced African systems. Another decisive factor for the future of black music in America was the ob- ligation to change linguistic systems.

> Thus, between the loss of a network of traditions thousands of years old and the impossibility of integrating completely or easily into a civilization of a new kind, blacks found themselves for a time in a cultural void of sorts. In order to gain control over such a disturbing situation, they had to invent an original, inevitably heterogeneous system of references by using the remaining African elements they still had access to, but also by practicing a kind of cultural poaching in their new surroundings.

Cultural cannibalisation of the ruling class

> He \[Jacob Burghardt, Du Bois’s great-grandfather] married a wife named Violet who was apparently newly arrived from Africa and brought with her an African song which became traditional in the family. . . . With Africa I had only one direct cultural connection and that was the African melody which my great-grandmother Violet used to sing. (Du Bois)

> The music consisted of two drums and a stringed instrument. An old man sat astride of a cylindrical drum about a foot in diameter, and beat it with incred- ible quickness with the edge of his hand and fingers. The other drum was an open staved thing held between the knees and beaten in the same manner. . . . The most curious instrument, however, was a stringed instrument which no doubt was imported from Africa. On the top of the finger board was the rude figure of a man in a sitting posture, and two pegs behind him to which the strings were fastened. . . . [Another instrument], which from the color of the wood seemed new, consisted of a block cut into something of the form of a cricket bat with a long & deep mortice down the center. This thing made a considerable noise, being beaten lustily on the side by a short stick. In the same orchestra was. . . . also a calabash with a round hole in it, the hole stud- ded with brass nails, which was beaten by a woman with two short sticks. (Benjamin Harry Latrobe)

> I think that music, being an expression of the human heart, or of the human being itself, does express just what is happening. I feel it expresses the whole thing—the whole of human experience at the time that it is being expressed. —John Coltrane, interviewed by Frank Kofsky, Jazz and Pop (September 1967), 26.
