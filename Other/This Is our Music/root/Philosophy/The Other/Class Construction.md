To understand where the racialisation of music, along with the stereotypes it brings, comes from, it is possible (and, I argue, necessary) to turn to [[Marxist Historical Materialism]] and [[Neo-Marxist Theory]]. When viewed through a socio-economic lens, then, the racial connotations present in music today bear an undeniable link, now buried under centuries of social change, to the [[Slave Trade]] itself. The process of class construction, like that of [[Building the Enemy|Othering]], always start in an extremely explicit way, which is then to some degree immediately occulted and repressed, and fades into the collective subconscious of the perpetrator.

## A Genealogy of Race

It is impossible for us to empirically trace the history of the concept of Race[^1], however it is significantly simpler for us to propose a model to explain the process of [[Terminology#^053aea|racialisation]]. 

#othering
To do so, we must start by positing that racialisation is always, at least to some degree, a conscious endeavour on the part of its perpetrator, although it is quickly assimilated into the collective unconscious of the perpetrator's group. Its aim, we should assume, is twofold: it has a positive purpose of [[Terminology#^78a6c2|Othering]] individuals, creating a power imbalance that can be used favourably by the "in group", and a negative one, which, through the exclusion of the outcasts, creates a group identity (or, in [[Neo-Marxist Theory|Marxist]] terms, a class identity), which brings a list of psychological as well as socio-economic benefits to its members (also see [[Building the Enemy]]).
Although there are plenty of examples of this type of tribal dynamic in human history, for the purposes of this work we are to focus mainly on the operation of racialisation acted out by [[Terminology#^e17a0f|Europeans]] towards European colonies and, in particular, African colonies. 

#class-construction
In doing so, Europeans _created_ a racial categorisation[^2] _ex novo_, and attributed to it racial markers (not always as obvious as one's skin colour). In doing so, they projected onto this newfound racial group the qualities that they found less desirable in a human, _de facto_ creating a metaphysical ideal similar to [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach's God]] in order to justify the creation of a hierarchy and subsequently dehumanise the members of this new "out group". Thus we create what, throughout the course of this work, I will refer to as the [[Terminology#^5bd23d|Black]] class, the proletariat, associated with the undesirable traits of Irrationality, Violence, Viscerality, Ignorance, and Animality, and the [[Terminology#^cf7428|White]] class, the bourgeoisie, which possesses the virtues of Intelligence, Peacefulness, Rationality and Humanity. It is central to my point that the White class is negatively derived from the Black one, and so are all of its metaphysical attributes, obtained from negating the ones tacked onto the Black class. 
#othering 
The ideal of White, of European intended as a race, and not simply as an intellectual and artistic tradition, post-dates the idea of Black: there must always be a You before there can ever be an I. The category of “Black” is born for the sole purpose of objectification, since its sole reason for existence is to be the subject to the predicates that European culture seeks to attribute to it. If we look one step ahead, then, we can say that the only reason the Black class exists is to affirm the existence of the White class: Europe affirms its “racial” (a newly found term) identity by estranging everyone else from it: thus Blackness only exists as a category of oppression and as a mean for Whiteness to come into existence and oppress the Black, proletariat class under ethical, aesthetic and even socio-economical lenses. This thesis is supported by the history of racialisation, which only emerges _during_ the [[Slave Trade]], as a posterior justification: by negating the humanity of the slaves, the Europeans were entitled to their trade, and through this exact dialectic operation, the Black class was created[^3].
#hegel
If we assume a storicist perspective, and view the need for the creation of a group of belonging, a tribe, inside of which an individual may feel safe, we can easily apply Hegelian thinking to this type of dialectic, seeing the collective as the thesis, the You as the antithesis, and the I as a final synthesis[^4]. Only by extricating ourselves from our own consciousness and stepping out into the wild can we meet others, and through the violent operation of making them the Other can we finally return to ourselves, having found not only an identity, but a group of people that fit our own description. Of course, in the case of racialisation, the end goal isn't only to create a tribe of our own, but to create a power imbalance between ourselves and our Others, with the explicit goal of maintaining an advantageous position in their regards. 
#violence #systematic 
Whether this dialectic happens through the need for a sense of belonging or through pure will to power, it is always an action characterisable as _violent_, as [[Judith Butler]] would argue in her '_The Force of Non Violence_'. We (meaning the class that will emerge as a result of the final synthesis of this triad) are, with varying degrees of consciousness, purposefully classifying and therefore excluding a set class of people based on certain arbitrary criteria, which can range from the most trivial and accidental - profession, age, favourite book or TV series - to the most essential - gender, heritage, religion, sexuality -, oftentimes against their will. Now, of course this does not constitute violence as we intend it colloquially today, however if we look at the very core of the idea of violence itself, this would be a pretty apt description of (nonphysical) violence. This does not necessarily characterise every such act as ethically or morally wrong - depending on the system we decide to abide, if any - but it is worth considering that, since the creation of a sense of tribal belonging is often considered the basis for a large scope of human interactions as we intend them, that the _a priori_ requisite for such interactions is a violent one. The question then, is: can this type of violence ever be considered ethical? If so, what sets "ethical dialectic violence" apart from its unethical companion? Of course, I do not claim to be able to give an absolute answer, as the scope of this work is much more restricted, but I would like to posit that what turns trivial dialectic violence into discrimination (which is, of course, itself a type of violence) is the [[Systemic Oppression|systemic]] aspect of the power imbalance created by this situation. Sexism and racism (ugly words to describe even uglier realities) are made such not only by the creation of 'in' and 'out' groups, but also by the unequal distributions of power (or, in [[Material Feminism|materialistic]] and [[Neo-Marxist Theory|Marxist]] terms, of the means of production) that see one group (or Class) as the sovereign and owner of the other.
#feuerbach #nietzsche
This process of construction is perhaps even more aptly classifiable as _creation_, intended in its truest meaning of extrication of concepts and qualities from one's self and their subsequent projection onto an external metaphysical object, which is subsequently often fetishised and made into a solid reality, like is the case with [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s God. 
#genealogy
The idea of tracing a genealogy itself comes from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s work and, in particular, from his Genealogy of Morals, and it seems particularly apt for the task that I am undertaking. The idea of morals, too, according to Nietzsche, is in itself absurd, and it seems absurd to consider it as a monolithic entity that either has always existed or suddenly and readily sprung into existence. It is then our duty, in order to understand its inner workings, to try and trace its history as far back as reason and evidence will allow us, and to subsequently use this information to break it down, using Nietzsche's hammering approach, so that we may do away with it for good.

## Biological Justification

The argument that “there are innate biological/genetic differences between members of the White and of the Black class” is not only pointless (because it is founded on the concept of a binary genotypic reality, where one end corresponds to Whiteness and the other to Blackness), but also a _retrospective justification_, since only after the birth of the racial oppression system – or the racialisation of the Other –  do we consider this Other not only phenotypically different (as in exhibiting, for example, a different skin colour), but also _essentially_ different, as if a darker skin tone, or any other different phenotypic reality was determined by a genotypic difference which in turn determined a different state of being of the Other compared to the European. 

Thus, even the arguments supporting a view of equality in _racial_ difference are ruinous, for they, in turn, stand on the shoulders of the racially oppressive Marxist dualist system, which is the reason we consider there to be ontological differences between the White and the Other in the first place. The reality is that the “white” racial marker serves as a means to “_distinguish dominating ethnic groups from subaltern ones_”[^5], and is thus only an instrument of power derived from the ethically and dialectically necessary operation of Othering of the Black class. 

Furthermore, the shameful implementation of the “one drop” rule in [[Racial Segregation#^8ac399|Jim Crow]] legislation only goes to prove how absurd the argument of “biological” or, rather, “essential” differences is.
