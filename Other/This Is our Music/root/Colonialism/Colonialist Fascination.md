The concept that I, in this work, label as 'Colonialist Fascination' refers to the profound interest (and, in certain cases, to the fetishisation )of the Oppressor class (whatever the chosen category of oppression[^1] may be)  with its Other.  Sources like the watercolour titled “_The old plantation_”, representing religious and musical ceremonies carried out by Black slaves, give us a testimony of this very process: the White master is so fascinated by the musical and socio-cultural happenings of this Other culture that he cannot help but observe from afar and immortalise them.

This dynamic also reveals a perfect example of the [[Hegel|Hegelian]] slave-master dynamic: the bourgeoisie (the oppressor class, in this case represented by the White class) is somehow also dependent on the proletariat – a dependence which, in this case, is also reflected in the musical inferiority-complex of the White class, which seeks out Black musicians, as it sees in them unique musical qualities (while still maintaining a healthy detachment, as White music is clearly intellectually superior and of greater intrinsic artistic and cultural value) which it cannot in any way possess, given the _negative_ nature of the definition of White, derived as the direct ontological opposite of Blackness. This instance of the Hegelian slave-master dynamic further proves how deep the roots of systematic musical racialisation go, even in the Age of Acceptance, also dubbed the Age of the Politically Correct, by many who seek to maintain the status quo of racial separation founded on “biological truths” used as a retrospective justification for racial classification.

#colonialism #mystification
The chronicles, on part of the colonisers, of these “Other” worlds, so different from the European one in nature – although described through European and White sensibilities – create the imaginary of the exotic, the mystical, the far-away, magic, mysterious and dangerous nature of everything that is not conform to the White model of existence. We see this aspect of colonialism reflect itself on every type of White artistic production from the time: literature, which is, by its very nature, the most eloquent of them all, sees a great number of novels explore this almost magical, unintelligible and somehow dangerous and contagious aspect of the new colonies (see for example Kipling, 1901 and Conrad, 1899). In the world of visual arts, both Gauguin and Picasso seek models “untouched by civilization”, by painting scenes from the Tahitian exotic paradise (in the case of the former) or taking inspiration from cave paintings and the simplistic art style of what, in retrospect, was perceived as the African people (in the case of the latter).

The cultural and ontological superiority complex of the White man towards these Other worlds can do absolutely nothing to stop this magnetic pull – and, in some ways, it even encourages it. Minstrel shows are a prime example of this reality: the White man desires the music of the Other so deeply, he is curious about its different, sensual and exotic nature, that he is driven to assume the role of the Black man himself. By painting his face and wearing a slave’s clothes, in the Minstrel show the White man makes it acceptable for the White public to listen to Black music (or, rather, an eclectic mix of music with different derivations, as Ben Wynne, 2014, reminds us) without committing any immoral acts.
