## Jim Crow Legislation

Jim Crow legislation is a body of laws that thoroughly and arbitrarily set boundaries for which individuals were to be considered "White", initially through the infamous "one drop rule".
This type of discrimination is founded on the implementation of a “minimum requirement” to be legally categorised as Black (or, rather non-White). The specific requirement fluctuated throughout years and geographical location, but it essentially determined the percentage of non-White heritage one was allowed to have before crossing the color line. In other words, Jim Crow was founded on the ideal of the preservation of the purity of race, and on the desperate wish to avoid contamination from the Other – as well as, of course, the epistemological and socioeconomic othering of the subaltern class. The practical problems of this type of racial policing should be immediately obvious (as, I hope, are the ethical and humane ones): first of all, the accurate enforcement of such an absurd rule is near impossible. Black citizens with a light enough skin, for example, could lie about their heritage, as in the case of….[^1].

Precisely because of this reason, the phenomenon of _passing_ (living as a member of the opposite racial group) was extremely wide-spread during the period. Since the law itself was not founded on physical appearance (as that would have been even more absurd), it was oftentimes hard to judge, at first glance, where one belonged on the Whiteness spectrum. An additional problem, however, was posed by the geographical and temporal parameters of the law. A citizen could be white in one state and black in another, and previously legally white people could become black overnight. The fact that police officers, out of need, started circulating illustrated pamphlets to be used as indexes of skin tones in relation to ethnicities, although they were never truly official means of jurisdiction (Jim Crow segregation, in theory, had no interest in the phenotypical reality, as it seeked to preserve racial purity), only provides further evidence of the absurdity of claims of essential differences between Whites and Others. 

The whole body of laws, in facts, only highlights the problems of assuming _a priori_ biological and genetic racial difference as true. While, of course, certain heritages share certain genetic markers, it is a whole other thing to base racial categorisation on those markers or, as was done back then, on their presumed phenotypical expressions.

Mixed bands as well as audiences, in jazz, posed a problem, as well as a challenge, to Jim Crow.
