The White-centric racial frame is defined by Feagin ([2009] 2013: 3) as:

“An overarching white worldview that encompasses a broad and persisting set of racial stereotypes, prejudices, ideologies, images, interpretations and narratives, emotions, and reactions to language accents, as well as racialized inclinations to discriminate. [...] For centuries now, it has been a dominant and foundational frame from which a substantial majority of white Americans—as well as many others accepting or seeking to conform to white norms and perspectives—view our still highly racialized society.”

As Ewell (2019) argues, this “overarching white worldview” (Ibid.) permeates the world of music theory and music education, where the musicians who are considered worthy of being celebrated and taught are, consistently, White men. This might not appear as a shocking fact at first glance, given how used we are to institutionalised racism (and misogyny), but if we paid more attention to this type of figure, we might actually be able to understand what its system-wide implication is.
