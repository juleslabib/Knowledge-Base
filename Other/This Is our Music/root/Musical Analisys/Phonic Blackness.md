Through the process described by [[Class Construction]] the White class identifies the intellectual as well as the physical attributes of the Black class. Of course, because of this, it also attributes characteristics to its music. These can range from the most innocuous classifications (like a critic calling a Black man's voice "soulful" regardless of his actual singing style) to the most harmful. Through the separation of the White and the Black class, the model of the Black Person is born, and so, as a consequence, is that of Black Artistic Production. Thus, the same classifiers imposed upon the Black class apply: Black Artistic Production could never be intellectual, refined, or beautiful, as all of these characteristics strictly pertain to the White class.

In this very same idea, however, lies the reason for the [[Colonialist Fascination]] with the artistic product of the Black class: the very same qualities that were attributed arbitrarily to it by the White class in order to render it clearly and unequivocally inferior to White Artistic Production make it all the more fetishisable and desirable. Through the eyes of the White class, Black music has a visceral, almost animal pull to it (because individuals belonging to the Black class have been made out to be, themselves, visceral and animalistic). This fascination, although made implicit and deeply worked into our subconscious in [[Sigmund Freud|freudian]] manner[^1], still persists today, and is precisely what gives birth to all those 'positive' classifications and racialisations of music by non-European artists[^2]. The black aesthetic, then, is often fetishised by the [[Music Business|music market]], like in the case of Elvis Presley, a White musician playing music in the style of many Black musicians at the time (i.e Little Richard), who was seen as a socially acceptable way for White audiences to enjoy what was, substantially, Black music. If we go further back, we encounter Minstrel Shows, which were born of the same [[Colonialist Fascination]] and permitted White performers to step out of the role that they negatively derived for themselves. Even today, although in somewhat more subtle terms, the same type of fetishisation persists, as a series of musical stereotypes and racialised words bound to racial markers.   

 Phonic Blackness uses racial classes and their attributes as departure points, and it serves both as a means of categorisation and as a metre of judgement for the musical prowess of both White and Black jazz musicians. The earliest example of the employment of the Ideal of phonic Blackness can be identified with the designation of rhythm as the most ancient of musical traditions and the equation “drum=primitive=Africa=Black”, which seeks to validate racial Attributes pushed on the Black class for the purposes of domination. Since rhythm is seen as an element strongly bound to the Black reality, then it follows naturally that expressions describing specific microtiming practices (such as swing, groove or pocket) should be also seen as strictly Black prerogatives. It is through similar procedures that many other phonically Black elements are derived. The idea of the existence of “black voices”, for example, derives from the association of the Black musician with a Christian background, and through it with Christian hymns from the baptist and evangelical churches, or even with the rural blues (which is often, in the collective White subconscious, tightly bound to the experience of spirituality and soulfulness – a fact that sounds extremely absurd, if one knew even as little as the lyrics to a single rural blues recording). A further example of phonic Blackness is the stark separation between “Black jazz” and “White jazz”, which will be discussed shortly – the former being associated with the “hot” phrasing style of bebop, and the former being associated with the “cooler” California or West Coast sound.

What all of these examples have in common is their origin. Each one of them stems from a different Attribute of the Black class (like primitivity, soulfulness or viscerality), and they all aim to delineate and categorise the role of the Black musician and of their music. The peculiar thing about them, however, is that they see supporters and objectors in both the White and the Black class. Although it seems superfluous to posit that they were, originally, intellectual categories constructed by the White class, it is nevertheless worth remarking that they were just as promptly embraced by both classes alike. A few Black musicians, without a doubt, interpreted these as points of racial pride, reclaiming the Attributes imposed over them from the White class as their own (in what we could identify as the second fase of the [[Post-Colonial Literature|post-colonial model]]). Many more, however, saw them for what they were –  pointless racialisations of music itself, which, in its purest form, knew no race. Being the class that created these mental categories in the first place, most of the White class agreed (as many still do, to this day) with its prejudices.

> Among the many implications of the stark contrast drawn in sonic stereotypes of black sounds and white sounds are its gendered associations Here African American aesthetics are coded as manly and virile, and the white aesthetic by contrast is coded as feminine or, at least, less virile (Ingrid Monson)

## The role of Harmony in African Music
> The place of harmony in African American aesthetics, I believe, is crucial in moving beyond the excessive stereotyping of black music as primarily characterised by rhythm, as well as the over attribution of the harmonic elements of music as white.

Marshall Sahlins and the "indigenisation of modernity" - the way in which "the incorporation of a borrowed cultural resource becomes a means of articulating difference down the line." (Monson). African American vocal harmony, for example, has been found in late studies (sources in Monson) to be the source of the barbershop quartet, which is now conceptualised as "quintessentially white". In reality, the inevitable contact between African America and Western harmonic practices gave birth to an exquisitely Black harmonic practice, often aurally transmitted in the circles of African American musicians. This practice, then, got borrowed back and once again adopted into Western musical practice, but from a purely genealogical standpoint, it is clear how they evolve from a strongly "Black" conception of music itself.

## "Black Music" Today

Given this problematic history of the concept of _'Black Music'_, it is but natural to doubt its place in today's musical and social vocabulary. If it is true (and it is undeniably true) that racial categorisation is born out of the will to belittle and subjugate, and that there is no racial categorisation in a society free from racism itself, why should we (if at all) continue using this term when talking about jazz? Is it not contradictory to point out the nefarious origin of racial categories and, at the same time, ascribe a type of music production to one of those categories we seek to abolish? Why keep using the word “Black”, when it is not a descriptive word (in the sense that there is not, geographically speaking, a Black People, and at the same time it doesn’t refer exclusively to people with black skin), but one born out of the will of Europeans to subdue the colonised and enslaved?

Furthermore, as Zenni (2016[^3]) promptly points out, jazz, while it was indubitably created by African American musicians, received an incredible number of influxes from European and Jewish musical practices, rendering it “_everyone’s music_” (_ivi:_ 91). 
It seems like all we're doing by choosing to continue using this term is picking and choosing which racial stereotypes are pretty enough for us to keep, just as liberal feminists do with their sweet and inadvertently profoundly sexist slogans. It's almost like we are deciding which categories of oppressions we're content with. Members of the White class, in particular, tend to do so because of a sense of guilt towards the nefarious doings of their ancestors, just as many men tend to understand feminist struggle to be simply a request for permission to exist as a woman. I do not think that this is the only way in which one might intend the term 'Black music'.

Both [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Monique Wittig]], after breaking down the concepts morals and gender respectively, ask this same question - whether it is appropriate, or even necessary, to use terms employed by the system one is seeking to effectively destroy -,  and arrive at two conclusions that are, I think, incredibly helpful to this work. The first one is that we cannot simply 'do without' the concept that we are trying to abolish. We are working from within a system, in this case a [[Racial Frame]], and we need to exploit its terms to highlight its fallacies. The second conclusion is that words hold power precisely of their history and their belonging to a certain system. 

Black music should be celebrated as such precisely because of the history of oppression that it carries. While it is true that there is no “Black People”, it is at the same time true that systematic oppression and racialisation (and the [[Black Nationalism|Black Nationalist]] responses to such realities) did, somehow, create a sense of identity, both internal and external to the oppressed classes. In response to the wave of hate and discrimination, BIPOC themselves constructed a shared sense of (social) identity, as attested by the numerous inclusive[[Civil Rights Movements]], born out of the will of the entire racial proletariat, which defined itself not because of a shared nationality, but because of a shared history of oppression. 
Likewise, Black music is not music created by a certain group of people, but it is music created by an oppressed racialised community, and should thus be acknowledged as such. Influences on the music, in this discourse, are not as relevant as the oppression history of the Black class, and the role that jazz music played in said history.

It is all too easy for the White jazz musician to dismiss the Blackness of the music as a thing of the past, given that they are privileged enough to benefit of the product of the creativity (as is prerogative of the bourgeoisie) of a class whose oppression their ancestors took part in[^4]. 
Because of this, jazz at its core is, and always should be considered, Black music - not because it is the product of a “racial group”, not because it has intrinsic characteristics that are exclusive to non-Whites (or non-Europeans), but because it carries a cultural, social and political meaning that should not be erased: that of class struggle, order subversion and Civil Rights action.

## Colourblindness in Music

Furthermore,  between the Forties and the Sixties there was a large debate on the colourblindness of jazz music. Many musicians, both from the White and from the Black class, supported this idea wholeheartedly. Jazz, after all, was (and still is) perceived (especially by White musicians) as music born from the encounter of different cultures, both of European and extra-European natures, and thus it appeared pointless to racially mark any of its many aspects. 

#segregation
People like Norman Granz coupled this view of musical colourblindness with active Jim Crow opposition, stating that “_pigmentation differences have no place in jazz. \[...\] It \[jazz\] is the perfect medium for bringing about a better understanding among all people_”. Granz would also host completely integrated shows, featuring prominent musicians from the White as well as from the Black class, as well as a completely integrated audience.

#todo : look for Ingrid Monson sources
Despite the high potential for social equality of a concept as strong as musical colourblindness, it still served as a double edged sword of sorts. If, on the one side, it became a tool for legal, social and cultural integration between White and Black citizens and musicians, on the other it had the (partly inadvertent) effect of weakening (or cancelling entirely) the strong relationship between the Black class and jazz music (which, for the purposes of this work, can be seen as its direct cultural product). Monson (...) would call this “_racial evasiveness_” (p. …): the hurried and almost shameful act, on part of the White class, to deny any racial implications of jazz itself. Jazz is, without a doubt, a strongly racial and racialised music – the White class itself made sure of it – and any attempt at dismissing this claim should be looked at with at least a slight degree of suspicion, especially when it “_\[fails\] to address the [[Music Business|power relationships]] involved in an economic and ideological climate_” (_ibid._) and makes no effort in linking the music itself with what was its historical and political meaning."

> The link between the discourse of colorblindness and and modernist aesthetics in jazz was forged through the notion of music itself as a higher principle than race. Yet the critical standards of classical music were the ones usually mobilised to establish what was modern. \[...]

> Assimilate modern jazz to the standards of European art music rather than question the universal applicability of those criteria. 

> Hodeir argued that the cool tendency represented the "furthest point reached to date in the evolution of jazz".

> By emphasising formal variety Hodeir implicitly places Mulligan's and Evans's arrangements in the company of great modern European composers, such as Stravinsky or Schoenberg, who also shunned the obviousness of logical symmetrical forms.

Or, rather, Hodeir implicitly attributed a greater value to the compositions of Mulligan and Evans precisely because they fit into the narrative of European music.
