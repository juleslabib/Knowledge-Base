# This Is Our Music
Before anything can be said on the topic of jazz as a post-colonial art form, there are some premises to be made. The main interest of this work is to understand and deconstruct the racially connotated assumptions made about this music and its musicians. Although the racial discrimination black musicians faced in [[Music Business]]  is, today, widely accepted as a matter of fact, we often fail to understand just how deep it runs. 

I propose that, through the lenses of [[Marxist Historical Materialism]] and [[Colonial Studies]], one can clearly observe and understand the power dynamics that act upon the production of Black American Music, as well as, in some cases, the social significance of some of the streams of jazz music. Through an analysis of the [[Civil Rights Movements]] of the XX Century, it becomes readily apparent that music in general, and jazz music more specifically, was and, in many ways, still is, at the centre of a socio-economic struggle rooted in centuries of [[Systemic Oppression]], which, in music, is expressed more than explicitly through [[Musical Critique]] and its strongly paternalistic and [[Phonic Blackness|racialised language]].  

All of this is enough to prompt a serious reflection on the term "[[Black American Music]]" and its direct and indirect implications, as well as a serious look at [[Material Feminism|feminist theory]] and its [[Intersectionality|intersectional applications]].

From a purely musical standpoint, I propose the use of a [[Post-Colonial Literature|post-colonial model]] for the understanding of jazz music and its streams, as well as a reflection on the differences between the art form of jazz (especially that of [[Avant Garde Jazz]] music) and of [[XX Century Improvised Music]]. To accomplish both of these goals, a thorough analysis of musical production both in jazz and classical music of the twentieth century is required, as well as a look to the concepts of [[Embodied Cognition]] relating to musical phenomena and the idea of [[Timbre]].

Only after this long journey through the jazz art form and the socio-economic context in which it was born, can we truly understand the power dynamics within it and its role in society, then and now.
